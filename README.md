# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

1. Clone the repo

    $ git clone git@github.com:ottav14/beerbrot.git

2. Navigate to root directory
    
    $ cd beerbrot

3. Run build command

    $ Make

    or

    $ Make run

    to build and run in one line

Run this after building to launch the program

    $ ./Beerbrot

If you cannot run this command make sure run permissions are enabled on the file

    $ chmod +x Beerbrot

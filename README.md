A Mandelbrot set visualizer by Dom Ottaviano.

# BUILD REQUIREMENTS

 - OpenGL (most likely pre-installed)
 - GLFW (very common windowing api, may also already be installed)
 - A C compiler (would be impressive if you didn't have this on your machine)

# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

To download and build, run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ottav14/beerbrot.git
cd beerbrot
Make
```

Run this after building to launch the program:

```bash
./Beerbrot
```

If you cannot run this command make sure run permissions are enabled on the file:

```bash
chmod +x Beerbrot
```
